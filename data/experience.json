We found out what Codesniffer, tests and CI were. At first we used Travis but then we subscribed for Bitbucket Jira & Confluence and we started to use Bitbucket Pipelines. We learned how to write Nette Extension and soon we had our own Packagist. Also we used some Symfony packages like Validation and Console. The project itself was hosted on Amazon EC2."
